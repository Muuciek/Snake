# Snake

Snake game made in C++ with SFML. Project is unfinished (eg. options feature is missing) but core functionality works well.

## How to run it

Since it is made using SFML so you need to install it first. It works on windows, haven't tested it on linux yet.

### Installing SFML

- Download SFML from [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)
- Unzip it
- Configure your project dependencies like [this](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-vc.php)
